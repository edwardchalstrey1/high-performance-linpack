[HPL - High Performance Linpack Benchmark](https://www.top500.org/project/linpack/)
====

Testing on multiple computing platforms with Docker

Using Ubuntu, I have created a Docker image that installs the dependencies, then downloads, compiles, configures and runs the HPL benchmark. The benchmark measures performance in solving a dense system of linear equations; the user is able to scale the size of the problem.

This repo has been developed as an example of using containerisation for benchmarking in the [TuringBench project](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/data-science-benchmarking/) at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/)

The [notebook in this repo](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/high-performance-linpack/blob/master/HPL_benchmarks_workflow_example.ipynb) provides an example of the TuringBench benchmarking workflow.
